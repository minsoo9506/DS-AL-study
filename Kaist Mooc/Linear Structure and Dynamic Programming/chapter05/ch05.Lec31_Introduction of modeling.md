## Models and why modeling?
- it is difficult to trace the real-world problem!
    - we create a model that simplifies the real-world problem
        - model : simplication of the real world problem, essence of the real world problem
- 완벽은 더 이상 더할게 없을 때가 아니라 더 이상 뺄게 없을 때!

## Two types of models
- Model to solve
    - Numerical modeling
        - linear programming, integer programming
        - Goal : converting the real world problems into formula, then finding optimal solutions through solvers
- Model to simulate
    - System dynamics, discrete event models, agent based models
        - event grphs, petri-net, agent modeling
        - Goal : approximating to the real world problems, then finding the optimal solutions through repetitive simulations
