## Definition of algorithm analysis
- Estimating the resources that the algorithm requires
    - memory
    - communication
    - **computational time**
- Factors affecting the running time
    - computer used for executions
    - algorithm 
    - data structure
    - input data size
- after analyzing the algorithms
    - we estimate the worst-case of the cost by the factors
