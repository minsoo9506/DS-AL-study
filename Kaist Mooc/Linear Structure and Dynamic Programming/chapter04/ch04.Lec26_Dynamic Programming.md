- solving overlapping sub-instance
- Main Storyline
  - Setting up a recurrence
    - Relating a solution of a larger instance to solutions of some smaller instances
    - Solve samall instance once
    - Record solutions in a table
    - Extract a solution of a larger instance from the table

## Memoization

- key technique of dynamic programming
- storing the results of previous function calls to reuse
- Bottom-up approach
  - Recursion : Top-down of divide and conquer
  - Dynamic programming : Bottom-up of solving and building
