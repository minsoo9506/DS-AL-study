## characteristics of trees
- Num of edges = Num of nodes - 1
- Depth of root = 0
- Height of root = Height of tree
- Max num of nodes at level i with degree d = $d^i$
- Max num of leaves with height h and degree d = $d^h$
- Max size of a tree with height h and degree d = $1 + d + d^2 + ... + d^h = \frac{d^{h+1}-1}{d-1}$
- Height of a complete tree with size s and degree d = $log_d { s(d-1)+1} = h+1$
